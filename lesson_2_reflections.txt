What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initial structure is created, with a pointer to the directory.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A gate, mid-stage. Offers safety/security; the ability to change one's mind.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use (1) 'git diff' and (2) 'git diff --staged' to compare (1) the working directory to the staging area, and (2) the staging area to the recent commit.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When experimenting/testing new ideas that deviate from the project so far. Or when collaborating with others.
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
There should be actual graphs in the command line... maybe there are in the GUI version.
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Having all commits reachable in one path. The diagram shows what's missing in the command line.
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Pro - no (or less) room for human error and less human work. Con - if any, room for machine error.
